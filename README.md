Next.js has great support for scoped css thanks to `styled-jsx` implementation. However, using only styled-jsx and a large and existing project can be difficult and a bit extreme. Global styles however can be more familiar and most designers already know how to work with them.

This react component allows you to include `css` files in your pages. It does not matter how you generate the css file, wether you edit it directly, generate it with `less` or `sass` or you automatically build it with your editor. The file will be releloaded and if the style changes it will be applied.

###Â Install

    npm install next.js-css-poller

### Example

    export default () =>
      <div>
        <CssPoller href="/static/ciao.css" />
        <p>ciao</p>
      </div>

### Notes

- Don't put this component inside next's Head component. It will not work properly.
- This component polls every second the server to look for style changes. This is inefficient and it should not be used in production.
- I am still looking for transparent way to avoid polling when in production.
